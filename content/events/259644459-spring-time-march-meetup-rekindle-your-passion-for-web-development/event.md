We have managed to invite Google Product Manager of Firebase Michael McDonald to give us a talk at our meetup. Unfortunately he has to leave on the 25th, so we decide to reschedule our Meetup to this weekend on the 23rd March at FirstServer.

In addition James McGrath will also talk about building the Mamamia website.

As usual, all you need is a good mood and an open mind for the meetup.
After the talks we will be going out for drinks & we can continue our conversations at the nearby Izakaiya.

Please note that we will be starting the Meetup at 18:00. We shall be hosting it at FirstServer and NOT at the original venue GVH5
