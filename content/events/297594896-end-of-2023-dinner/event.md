Can you believe it? 2023 is coming to an end. 🤯

And how busy of a year it was! We certainly are finding us looking forward for a bit of a rest and push a bit of a break on the regular events for our End-of-Year dinner.

This year we are having it at [Nanone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sye9edTB7uxUBFe46) this year, a nice Izakaya with an excellent kitchen. Join us at 17:00 for a 3h dinner with 飲み放題 (all-you-can-drink). ( [Countdown](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20231223T17&p0=671) )

We hope that you can join us, but if not, maybe you want to come by at our Kyoto event this month: [KWDDM - Light December Talks - 2023/12/10](https://www.meetup.com/kyoto-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/297504081/)

In any case, we hope you have a good end of year and we see you again in 2024!
